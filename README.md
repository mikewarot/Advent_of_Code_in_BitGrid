# Advent_of_Code_in_BitGrid
My solutions to the Advent of Code, using a BitGrid

A BitGrid is a novel computing model, which consists of a sea of Look Up Tables (LUTs) connected to neighbors, and latched in 2 phases, to solve all timing issues usually associated with FPGAs and most digital logic.

I have a simulator, open source and available in the BitGrid repository https://github.com/mikewarot/Bitgrid

I'll be updating it, adding everything needed to support this effort. A complete computing ecosystem has to be built if I'm to finish all of the puzzles this year.

I'm not sure I can get this done before Advent of Code 2024... wish me luck.
